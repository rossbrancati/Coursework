Course Description: 

This course provides an introduction to fundamental computer science concepts relevant to the statistical analysis of large-scale data sets. Students will collaborate in a team to design and implement analyses of real-world data sets, and communicate their results using mathematical, verbal and visual means. Students will learn how to analyze computational complexity and how to choose an appropriate data structure for an analysis procedure. Students will learn and use the python language to implement and study data structure and statistical algorithms.

This course make use of the MIT OCW Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python [1] and the MIT OCW Introduction to Algorithms [2].
