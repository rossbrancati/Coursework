Course Description: 

This course will introduce core machine learning models and algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. On the theory side, the course will focus on effectively using machine learning methods to solve real-world problems with an emphasis on model selection, regularization, and empirical evaluation. The assignments will involve both mathematical problems and implementation tasks. Knowledge of a high-level programming language is absolutely necessary. Python is most commonly used (along with standard libraries such as numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn), but languages such as Matlab, R, Scala, Julia would also be suitable. While this course has an applied focus, it still requires appropriate mathematical background in probability and statistics, calculus, and linear algebra.
