Course Description: 

This course introduces core machine learning algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. It focused on both theory (effectively using machine learning methods to solve real problems) and practice (implementation of machine learning models). Assignments involved high level math and implementation of models through Python. 

Most of these scripts are manually implemented versions of the different algorithms we reviewed in class. There is also a folder with notebooks for a Kaggle competition we used for the final project.
